## Snake Game vs Annoying orange
Python Snake Game is an easy game where the player controls a snake that moves around the game board to pick up an annoying orange. As the snake eats the orange, it grows longer and longer, making the game more challenging.

The player must avoid running into the edges of the game board or the snake's own body, as this will result in a game over.

To control the snake, the player uses the arrow keys on the keyboard to direct it in the desired direction. The game speed increases as the player progresses, making it even more challenging to avoid collisions (NOT yet implemented). The objective is to collect as many oranges as possible without colliding with the walls or the snake's own body.
