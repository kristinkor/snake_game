# Snake & Annoying orange vs Apple*
##### *The game with the worst sound effect in the world! 
Python Snake Game is an easy game where the player controls a snake that moves around the game board to pick up an apple. As the snake eats the apple, it grows longer and longer, making the game more challenging. And making an annoying orange more glorious. 

The player must avoid running into the edges of the game board or the snake's own body, as this will result in a game over.

To control the snake, the player uses the arrow keys on the keyboard to direct it in the desired direction. The game speed increases as the player progresses, making it even more challenging to avoid collisions (NOT yet implemented). The objective is to collect as many apples as possible without colliding with the walls or the snake's own body.
